## [0.4.1] - 2023-01-28
### Changed

### Fixed
- Fixed a regression introduced in [#108](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/108) that lead to incorrect results for the 3B association scheme. [#129](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/129)

## [0.4.0] - 2023-01-27
### Added
- Added SAFT-VRQ Mie equation of state and Helmholtz energy functional for first order Feynman-Hibbs corrected Mie fluids. [#79](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/79)
- Added `estimator` module to documentation. [#86](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/86)
- Added benchmarks for the evaluation of the Helmholtz energy and some properties of the `State` object for PC-SAFT. [#89](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/89)
- The Python class `StateVec` is exposed in both the `feos.eos` and `feos.dft` module. [#113](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/113)
- Added uv-B3-theory and additional optional argument `virial_order` to uvtheory constructor to enable uv-B3. [#98](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/98)

### Changed
- Export `EosVariant` and `FunctionalVariant` directly in the crate root instead of their own modules. [#62](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/62)
- Changed constructors `VaporPressure::new` and `DataSet.vapor_pressure` (Python) to take a new optional argument `critical_temperature`. [#86](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/86)
- The limitations of the homo gc method for PC-SAFT are enforced more strictly. [#88](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/88)
- Removed generics for units in all structs and traits in favor of static SI units. [#115](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/115)

### Packaging
- Updated `pyo3` and `numpy` dependencies to 0.18. [#119](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/119)
- Updated `quantity` dependency to 0.6. [#119](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/119)
- Updated `num-dual` dependency to 0.6. [#119](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/119)


### Fixed
- Fixed incorrect indexing that lead to panics in the polar contribution of gc-PC-SAFT. [#104](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/104)
- `VaporPressure` now returns an empty array instead of crashing. [#124](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/124)

## [0.3.0] - 2022-09-14
- Major restructuring of the entire `feos` project. All individual models are reunited in the `feos` crate. `feos-core` and `feos-dft` still live as individual crates within the `feos` workspace.

## [0.2.1] - 2022-05-13
### Fixed
- Fixed a bug due to which the default ideal gas contribution was used for every equation of state. [#17](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/17)

## [0.2.0] - 2022-05-10
### Added
- Added [gc-PC-SAFT](https://github.com/feos-org/feos-gc-pcsaft) equation of state and Helmholtz energy functional.
- Added [PeTS](https://github.com/feos-org/feos-pets) equation of state and Helmholtz energy functional.
- Added [UV-Theory](https://github.com/feos-org/feos-uvtheory) equation of state for Mie fluids.

### Changed
- Combined all equations of state into a single Python class `EquationOfState` and all Helmholtz energy functionals into the Python class `HelmholtzEnergyFunctional`. [#11](https://github.com/feos-org/feos/pull/11)
