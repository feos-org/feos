## What it does

The `feos-derive` crate contains macros that provide boilerplate for the implementation of several traits from `feos-core` and `feos-dft` for the FFI conform enums in `feos`. With these macros, new equations of state and functionals can be added straightforwardly to the Python interface or other FFIs.
