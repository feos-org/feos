    "# On Dual Numbers in `FeOs`\n",
    "\n",
    "In `FeOs`, we use [generalized dual numbers](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fceng.2021.758090/full) to compute partial derivatives of the Helmholtz energy.\n",
    "In this notebook, we take a closer look at how that works.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will make use of the `UserDefinedEos` feature: we use a simple version of the Peng-Robinson equation of state implemented as Python class which is registered in `FeOs` as equation of state. \n",
    "If you want to learn how to implement an equation of state as Python class in conjunction with `FeOs`, take a look at the example implementation in the examples section.\n",
    "In short - a class that implements a `helmholtz_energy` function that takes a `StateD` (or *any* state object, where the internal data types can be any generalized dual number)\n",
    "and returns the Helmholtz energy (plus some minor functions), can be used with `FeOs`. We use the equation of state implemented in Python simply because we can add `print` statements and inspect the data types at runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dual Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't go into much detail regarding the theory of generalized dual numbers. Suffice it to say that generalized dual numbers are mathematical constructs consisting of one real value and one or more non-real values (just like complex numbers) that enable evaluation of arithmetic operations such that the operation *and* the derivative(s) can simultaneously be computed.\n",
    "We call these *generalized* dual numbers because they can have a different number of *non-real* values. For example a *dual number* has a real and a single non-real value and can be used to compute first (partial) derivatives, while a *hyper-dual number* has a real and three non-real values and can be used to compute first and second (partial) derivatives.\n",
    "We can - in principle - create numbers that allow computation of an arbitrarily high derivative at the cost of execution speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to numerical differentiation and complex step differentiation, a derivative is computed by defining a \"step size\". For complex step and dual number differentiation this step is introduced in the non-real part. Derivatives of dual numbers, however, are exact (to machine precision) and independent of the step size used. Hence, we use unity as step size.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when we feed a temperature as `Dual64` data type\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(temperature)\n",
    "300 + [1]Îµ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "into a function, its return value will be a `Dual64` as well. The non-real part of the function result *is* the derivative with respect to temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Do we need to create dual numbers by hand?\n",
    "\n",
    "No. If you use already implemented equations of state, you will not even recognize that dual numbers are used.\n",
    "However, if you use Python or Rust to implement you own equation of state, it is useful to know how `FeOs` creates and uses dual numbers.\n",
    "It's easier to look at an example than to talk about it. Below, you find the implementation of the Peng-Robinson equation of state where we added some `print` statement to the `helmholtz_energy` function to keep track of the values and data types of the thermodynamic state that enters the Helmholtz energy computation."
