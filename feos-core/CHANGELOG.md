  - `PhaseDiagramPure::new` -> `PhaseDiagram::pure`
  - `PhaseDiagramBinary::new_txy`, `PhaseDiagramBinary::new_pxy` -> `PhaseDiagram::binary_vle`
  - `PhaseDiagramBinary::new_txy_lle`, `PhaseDiagramBinary::new_pxy_lle` -> `PhaseDiagram::lle`
  - `PhaseDiagramHetero::new_txy`, `PhaseDiagramHetero::new_pxy` -> `PhaseDiagram::binary_vlle`\
  which still returns an instance of `PhaseDiagramHetero`
- Changed the internal implementation of the Peng-Robinson equation of state to use contributions like the more complex equations of state and removed the suggestion to overwrite the `evaluate_residual` function of `EquationOfState`. [#51](https://github.com/feos-org/feos-core/pull/51)
