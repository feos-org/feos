`feos-derive` is part of the [FeOs project](https://github.com/feos-org/feos).

> **FeOs - A Framework for Equations of State and Classical Density Functional Theory**

## What it does

The `feos-derive` crate contains two macros that provide boilerplate for the implementation of the `EquationOfState` and the `HelmholtzEnergyFunctional` trait for the `EosVariant` and `FunctionalVariant` enums of the `feos-crate`. With these macros, new equations of state and functionals can be added to the variants without any further implementations needed.
